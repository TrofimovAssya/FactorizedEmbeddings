# Factorized Embeddings
We present a factorized embedding method, that learns simultaneously gene and sample embeddings in their respective latent space, in a gene function-dependent manner. Running the model on RNA-Seq data, we observed that tissue samples aggregated spontaneously in latent space by tissue similarity while genes aggregated in latent space by gene function. Our method recovered most gene-gene association reported in reference databases, but also recovered gene associations found in the literature but absent in databases. Our approach has the potential to uncover not yet known gene interactions, in a tissue-specific manner.
